Changelog
=========

v0.8.0 (2026-09-16)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Client-side inference pipeline**: added ``Preprocessor`` / ``PreprocessMeta``, ``YoloV5Postprocessor`` / ``YoloV8Postprocessor``, ``InferencePipeline``, and ``PipelineRunner`` for model-derived preprocessing, source-coordinate mapping, replaceable postprocessing, asynchronous execution, and long-running latest-wins processing with backpressure and statistics
- **Platform-scheduled pipeline**: added ``StreamPipeline`` / ``StreamPipelineStatus``, combining ``InferenceClient.subscribe()`` with ``OverlayClient`` so inference, filtering, hardware overlay, and application-side result consumption work without bringing pixels into the application process; drop, latency, skew, and error metrics are exposed
- **Frame-injection output path**: added ``FramePublisher`` and ``CameraClient.push_frame()`` / ``injection_status()`` / ``stop_injection()`` with replace/overlay modes, NV12/RGB publishing, EOS restoration, and session tags; the write-lease-aware pool only reuses slots released by the daemon and falls back to depth-paced rotation on older daemons
- **Overlay frame sync and observability**: ``OverlayClient`` gained strict frame lock plus ``frame_sequence`` / ``stream_epoch`` / ``session_id`` binding; ``StreamStatus`` gained encoded-publisher, overlay-bake, strict-lock, late-command, and stale-epoch counters
- **Deployment diagnostics**: added the never-raising ``diagnostics()`` snapshot, requirement-based ``diagnostics.check()`` with aggregated failures, and the application-wide ``set_route_policy()`` acceleration control
- **Inference model metadata**: ``register_model()`` accepts ``batch_size``, ``ModelInfo`` passes through the server-side batch size, and ``InferenceResult`` exposes the server-computed ``skew_us``
- **End-to-end device-resident data path**: the DSP router reuses a process-wide client; ``resize_hw`` / ``convert_hw`` can return ``DspBufferRef`` with ``out="ref"``, inference consumes device-side refs directly, NV12 preprocessing can pass them through, and BLEND can target a ``FramePublisher`` pool slot without intermediate read-back or repeated imports
- **Area-bounded overlay rendering**: added ``render_overlay_fragments()``, splitting strokes into even-sized strips capped to the DSP batch limit to reduce full-frame ARGB overlay bandwidth and memory

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Frame`` crop/resize chains now retain composed geometry metadata; keep-fd frames remain device-side through preprocessing, inference, blending, and publishing, while the media and encoded clients expose additional drop and connection observability
- Added comprehensive on-device interface and performance suites plus a ``perf_demo`` with subscribe/keep-fd comparison chains, deployment scripts, and runtime metrics collection

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed three issues found by the on-device interface suite: DSP import ids with the high bit set were parsed as signed 64-bit values; ``get_device_status()`` read a nonexistent ``ir_led_on`` field; and ``AppClient.list_apps()`` constructed the wrong Empty message type
- Fixed injection shutdown omitting EOS, stop-from-callback attempting to join its own thread, and missing ``ttl_ms`` validation on some overlay publish paths
- Fixed DSP pools and references remaining usable after client close, retiring process-wide clients closing resources still in flight, and passthrough input refs not being released after inference settled
- Tightened overlay-fragment even geometry and batch limits, including the pre-edge-slide height rounding that could otherwise produce invalid strips

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- **Plugin system API** (``PluginDiscovery`` / ``PluginServer`` / ``PluginEndpoint``) is deprecated. The platform does not ship the ``/run/aipc/plugins`` discovery mechanism; v0.8.0 still keeps the imports working, emits a ``DeprecationWarning``, and leaves the docs page offline. Speak up if you depend on it.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed the video-stream examples across docs and README: dropped references to ``MediaClient`` (which never shipped), standardized on ``FdMediaClient``; stream IDs corrected from ``cam0_main`` / ``cam0_sub`` to the device-exposed ``main`` / ``sub``; removed usages of the nonexistent ``get_stream_info()`` / ``get_raw_stream()``; corrected the ``get_encoded_stream()`` return semantics and the flattened ``frame.data`` misuse; added API docs for ``EncodedStreamClient`` / ``EncodedFrame``
- Fixed missing and misleading imports in the application examples: added ``import time`` to the multi-model example, ``import json`` to the GenAI example; dropped ``from grpc import RpcError`` from the error-handling example (the SDK raises ``RuntimeError``); removed unused ``numpy`` / ``sys`` imports
- Synced the Chinese inference page with the English one: translated the seven Usage sections that had been English-only since v0.3.0 (segmentation, OCR, CLIP image embeddings, CLIP text encoding, depth estimation, runtime postprocess-config update, GenAI) and added the ``SegmentationMask`` / ``OcrLine`` / ``Embedding`` / ``DepthMap`` data-type entries
- Added pipeline, frame-injection, overlay, and performance documentation, plus the local-inference application and ``perf_demo`` examples

v0.7.4 (2026-09-08)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Convenience-layer hardware routing** (sdk-hardware-routing P5): ``color.rgb_to_nv12`` / ``color.nv12_to_rgb`` and ``draw.draw_detections`` (NV12 arrays) ride the accel router's DSP legs by default, degrading to the software impls with accounting when unavailable; ``Frame.to_jpeg_bytes`` is hardware-first for keep-fd frames (zero-copy camera-daemon ``EncodeImage`` import) while in-memory frames keep the direct CPU encode so streaming hot loops pay no extra copy or RPC; software legs bind private impls only — the routing public functions cannot re-enter the router
- ``Frame.resize``'s DSP fast path now respects the router policy: ``SOFTWARE_ONLY`` skips the attempt, ``HARDWARE_ONLY`` raises on failure (refusing the silent CPU fallback), ``PREFER_HARDWARE`` reports via the new ``AccelRouter.note_degradation()`` (plus a typed ``policy`` property; externally reported fallbacks on unregistered ops stay visible in ``health()`` and fire ``on_degradation``)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``_encode_jpeg_hw`` hardcoded ``fmt="rgb24"``, so every NV12 keep-fd frame submit was rejected by ``_resolve_source`` as a format mismatch; frame-like sources now carry their handle's format
- ``dsp_format``'s software leg re-entered the router through the routing public functions (cross-op coupling); it now binds the color impls directly
- unified the color legs' ``ValueError`` contract (ndim / declared dims / even-size checks run before any daemon submit — caller errors no longer land in the degradation counters)

v0.7.3 (2026-09-07)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Hardware-first accel router** (``accel`` module): ``AccelRouter`` / ``RoutePolicy`` / ``health()`` degradation accounting + ``on_degradation`` hook / ``get_default_router()``; the default router registers DSP legs for ``resize_nv12`` / ``rgb_to_nv12`` / ``nv12_to_rgb`` / ``encode_jpeg`` / ``draw_detections`` plus the ``nms`` software leg
- **DSP annotation compositing** (dsp-offload P1): ``DspClient.blend_hw`` composites ARGB32 overlays onto NV12 in place on the DSP; ``draw.render_overlay_rgba`` renders boxes+captions as a minimal straight-alpha canvas reproducing the software raster's output
- **Async DSP jobs** (dsp-offload P2): every ``*_hw`` op takes ``wait=False`` with ``PendingDspJob`` exposing ``wait()`` / ``done()`` / ``release()``; ``blend_hw`` zero-copy keep-fd chain (refused by default — a state-dependent fatal path on current firmware); ``encode_jpeg_hw`` ``src_buffer_id`` passthrough skips the pixel read-back; keep-fd frame sources skip the ``ascontiguousarray`` pre-copy in the resize/convert legs; polygon and track shapes
- **Overlay annotation**: ``annotate()`` / ``annotate_result()`` push detections straight to camera-daemon's renderer over the event bus
- **Color conversion and NMS**: BT.601 limited-range RGB↔NV12 (numpy path when cv2 is missing); cross-class-aware ``postprocess.nms``

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Finished the inference codec refactor: stray ``self`` in ``_tensor_to_numpy`` / ``_parse_post_result`` broke the respective parse paths; removed the four full method implementations the thin codec delegates silently shadowed; added AST structural meta-tests to catch this class of drift

v0.7.2 (2026-09-03)
-------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Stray ``self`` in the ``_parse_infer_response`` codec signature: after the 0.7.0 refactor every ``infer()`` / ``infer_batch()`` call raised ``TypeError``; added a regression test driving a real ``InferResponse``

v0.7.1 (2026-09-03)
-------------------

- Version aligned with ``setup.py``; no API changes

v0.7.0 (2026-09-02)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **App developer toolkit** (developed as 0.6.0, never released separately, shipped with 0.7.0):

  - ``Frame.crop()`` / ``Frame.resize()`` / ``Frame.to_jpeg_bytes()`` — crop, three resize modes (stretch/letterbox/crop), JPEG encoding; falls back to numpy/PIL when cv2 is missing
  - ``draw`` module — detection visualization (``draw_boxes`` / ``draw_text`` / ``draw_detections``)
  - ``recording`` module — pure-Python TS muxing, HLS segments, event pre-record buffer (``TsWriter`` / ``HlsWriter`` / ``PrerollBuffer``), no ffmpeg required
  - ``web`` module — MJPEG streaming (``MjpegServer`` / ``MjpegStream`` / ``mjpeg_wsgi_app``)
  - **DeviceClient** native autofocus group of 6 methods (``start_oneshot_af`` / ``start_zoom_follow`` / ``get_autofocus_status`` / ``cancel_autofocus`` / ``set_af_windows`` / ``get_af_measurement``)
  - **CameraClient** imaging/infrared/privacy-mask/OSD/config group of 12 methods (incl. IR preset management, ``get_osd`` symmetric with ``set_osd``)
- Fixed ``InferenceClient.subscribe()`` silently dropping failed frames

Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Internal layering: extracted the shared ``_transport`` primitives; split ``media`` into frame/encoded/fd_client, ``dsp`` into dsp_wire/dsp_format, ``inference`` into types/codec/genai. Facades keep every historical import path — **zero public API removals**
- DSP CPU fallback now raises a ``UserWarning`` instead of a silent log
- 2D-array grayscale inference input emits a ``DeprecationWarning`` (pass ``fmt=`` explicitly)
- ``EncodedStreamClient()`` default socket path is now ``/run/aipc/encoded/{stream}.sock`` (``ENCODED_SOCK_DIR`` env override; explicit paths still win)

Fixes
~~~~~

- Fixed an import crash on Python 3.8/3.9 (``from __future__ import annotations`` everywhere)

Other
~~~~~

- Added ``py.typed`` marker to the package; test suite grown to 270 green tests

v0.5.0 (2026-08-20)
-------------------

Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rebrand: ``hailo_ipc_sdk`` → ``neoruntime_ipc_sdk`` (breaking, no shim; functional names such as hailort/ne503/aipc are preserved)

Fixes
~~~~~

- Fixed dual-layout decoding of ``audio_capture`` video-layout headers

Other
~~~~~

- CI gained TestPyPI/PyPI trusted-publishing dual release flow

~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **DeviceClient** — 7 new methods:
  - ``set_lens_limits(zoom_limit, focus_limit)`` — Set lens axis position limits
  - ``oneshot_autofocus(timeout)`` — One-shot autofocus (composite: enable → wait for convergence → disable)
  - ``set_wiegand_out(channel, enable)`` — Wiegand output control
  - ``get_wiegand_out(channel)`` — Wiegand output state query
  - ``rs485_init(baudrate, config)`` — RS-485 serial initialization
